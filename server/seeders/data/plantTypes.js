These are easy to grow houseplants and offer a lot of variety, from low groundcover types to tall trees.

Its shiny leaves and gracefully arching branches give the tree a delicate, elegant appearance. Rubber trees are also popular upright types; they have large leaves, which are often flushed with shades of red and purple. Creeping figs are also common houseplants; they have small foliage and are excellent for hanging baskets. And fiddle leaf fig has become one of the trendiest houseplants because of its large, dramatic leaves.\n\nCreeping fig is an excellent choice for hanging baskets and growing on a mantle. Because of its tiny stature, creeping fig is also ideal for terrariums.",
    instructionsWeb:
      "Grow most ficus varieties in medium to bright light. If they don't get enough light, they'll grow slowly and have long stems, giving the plants an unattractive, lanky appearance. Most ficus varieties will tolerate some direct sun on their leaves when grown as houseplants, so they're great choices for sunny window sills. \n\nWater ficus when the top inch or so of the potting mix starts to feel dry to the touch. Ficus are quite resilient and survive inconsistent watering, but grow best when they get moisture on a regular basis. Creeping ficus varieties tend to want to be kept a little more moist than their upright-growing cousins. Don't let them dry out completely. \n\nFertilize ficus once or twice a year in spring and summer, when temperatures are warmer and plants are putting on more growth. You can fertilize your ficus more frequently if you wish; doing so will cause these plants to grow faster. \n\nPrune ficus anytime they start to get too large. Most types take well to pruning and will branch out, becoming thicker and bushier when you cut them back. One note: Ficus have a milky-white sap and some tips will drip sap after pruning. Use a rag or soft cloth to absorb the sap to prevent it from dripping on the floor. \n\nWhile ficus are easy to grow, weeping ficus in particular has a reputation for dropping a lot of leaves when it experiences a change in condition. So if your ficus loses leaves when you first bring it home, don't worry: It should regrow new foliage once it's adapted to its new location.",

While names like Chinese money plant and pancake plant refer to its leaf shape, the Pilea Sharing Plant™ and pass-it-on plant come from how easy it is to share with friends.

      "Looking for an easy-to-grow houseplant? Check out ZZ plant -- it's truly one of the toughest around, making it a perfect choice to add to your home or office. Whether you're able to give it steady care, travel a lot, or just get distracted by all the stresses of daily life, ZZ plant survives it all. Plus, it looks good: The plant features shiny, dark green leaves that look waxy (some people even think they're plastic). \n\nHaven't heard of ZZ plant? You're not alone; it deserves a lot more attention than it gets. It was discovered in Eastern Africa in the 1800s, but it wasn't until the 1990s that it really took off as a houseplant. While ZZ plant isn't exactly rare, it's still catching on -- so grow ZZ plant and you can be ahead of the trend.",
    instructionsWeb:
      "What makes ZZ plant such a good houseplant is that it's wonderfully tolerant to a wide range of conditions, including low light, low humidity, and periods of drought. That means it will survive just about any corner of your home, even if you only water it once every couple of weeks (it grows best, though, when watered as the top inch or two of the potting mix dries). Like most other plants, ZZ plant doesn't even need natural light -- it'll thrive just fine indoors under fluorescent lights, such as those in office buildings. \n\nAs a survival technique, ZZ plant has evolved to start dropping its leaflets to conserve moisture during periods of severe drought. If you forget to water yours and see the leaflets fall, don't give up hope. Water your plant again and it should resuscitate. It's best to water ZZ plant when the top inch or so of the soil dries. \n\nFertilize ZZ plant once every six months or so with a general-purpose fertilizer labeled for use on houseplants. You can also fertilize more frequently if you want your plant to grow larger and faster.\nDiscover some of our other favorite low-water houseplants!\n\nZZ plant is not recommended for human or animal consumption.",

      'For over a hundred years, Boston ferns have played a starring role inside and out of America homes. This voluptuous, easy-care, fern grows just as well on porches and patios as it does gracing your front hall or living room. Boston ferns graceful produce arching branches covered with soft, emerald-green fronds. Indoors, Boston ferns will also help remove toxins such as toluene and xylene from the air.',
    instructionsWeb:
      'Like other ferns, Boston fern is relatively easy to grow indoors or out. It does best in high humidity and with consistently moist soil. If it dries out too much, the fronds turn brown and crispy. Outdoors it thrives in shade or part shade, and appreciates protection from hot, drying winds. Indoors, it likes a medium to bright spot (but out of direct sun) and protection from hot, dry air coming from heating vents. Boston ferns enjoy being misted when grown inside over the winter. Fertilize every two months with a liquid houseplant fertilizer.',
