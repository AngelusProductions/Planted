    "description": "One of the boldest houseplants around, you can't miss crotons because of their colorful foliage. Often boldly marked with bright yellow, orange, red, and even black, crotons are perfect for adding a tropical touch to indoor decor. They're particularly eye-catching in bright dining rooms and living rooms where their foliage helps energize a room.\n\nBoost croton's appeal even more by growing yours in a colorful pot that accents the brilliantly colored foliage.",
    "instructions": "Grow crotons in a bright spot: They like lots of light to produce all those colorful leaves. If your croton doesn't get enough light, you might find the plant grows tall and lanky, with few leaves that don't have deep, rich hues. \n\nWater crotons when the soil starts to dry. They're not as thirsty as many other common houseplants, but will drop leaves if they stay too wet or too dry for extended periods. \n\nLike most houseplants, they also appreciate abundant humidity. You can boost humidity for your croton by growing it in a well-lit kitchen or bathroom, placing a small humidifier nearby, or grouping it nearby other houseplants. \n\nFertilize croton in spring and summer to keep it healthy and growing. Crotons only need fertilizer once or twice during the season, but you can get them to grow faster by fertilizing more frequently. Follow the directions on the fertilizer package whenever feeding your plants.",

    "name": "Elephant Ear",
    "description": "Elephant's ears are stunning houseplants. They often feature dark, shield-shaped foliage that may be accentuated by white veins running throughout the leaves. The plants will flower occasionally, sending up a spike with a calla-like white, light yellow, or cream bloom, but the foliage is the reason the plant is grown. Elephant's ear is the perfect plant for high-humidity areas such as bathrooms and kitchens.",
    "instructions": "Elephant's ear grows best in bright light. Too much direct sun, especially in hot-summer climates, can burn the leaves, so these exotic indoor plants benefit from the protection of a sheer curtain from the window. Being true tropicals, they love humidity, so boost moisture levels in the air if it's especially dry. Water as needed, when the top inch or two of the soil dries to the touch. \n\nFertilize elephant's ear a couple of times a year to keep it healthy. The best seasons are spring and summer. Use any fertilizer formulated for use on houseplants.",

    "name": "Ficus",
    "description": "Ficus -- also called figs -- are among the most popular indoor plants, and for good reason. These are easy to grow houseplants and offer a lot of variety, from low groundcover types to tall trees. Ficus also offer a variety of textures, so there's one for practically everyone's personal style.\n\nWeeping ficus is perhaps the most popular indoor tree. Its shiny leaves and gracefully arching branches give the tree a delicate, elegant appearance. Rubber trees are also popular upright types; they have large leaves, which are often flushed with shades of red and purple. Creeping figs are also common houseplants; they have small foliage and are excellent for hanging baskets. And fiddle leaf fig has become one of the trendiest houseplants because of its large, dramatic leaves.\n\nCreeping fig is an excellent choice for hanging baskets and growing on a mantle. Because of its tiny stature, creeping fig is also ideal for terrariums.",
    "instructions": "Grow most ficus varieties in medium to bright light. If they don't get enough light, they'll grow slowly and have long stems, giving the plants an unattractive, lanky appearance. Most ficus varieties will tolerate some direct sun on their leaves when grown as houseplants, so they're great choices for sunny window sills. \n\nWater ficus when the top inch or so of the potting mix starts to feel dry to the touch. Ficus are quite resilient and survive inconsistent watering, but grow best when they get moisture on a regular basis. Creeping ficus varieties tend to want to be kept a little more moist than their upright-growing cousins. Don't let them dry out completely. \n\nFertilize ficus once or twice a year in spring and summer, when temperatures are warmer and plants are putting on more growth. You can fertilize your ficus more frequently if you wish; doing so will cause these plants to grow faster. \n\nPrune ficus anytime they start to get too large. Most types take well to pruning and will branch out, becoming thicker and bushier when you cut them back. One note: Ficus have a milky-white sap and some tips will drip sap after pruning. Use a rag or soft cloth to absorb the sap to prevent it from dripping on the floor. \n\nWhile ficus are easy to grow, weeping ficus in particular has a reputation for dropping a lot of leaves when it experiences a change in condition. So if your ficus loses leaves when you first bring it home, don't worry: It should regrow new foliage once it's adapted to its new location.",

    "name": "Monstera",
    "description": "Monstera may be the perfect houseplant for you if you're looking to create a big, bold, tropical feel in your home. It features big (2-foot-wide) leaves that look like they have holes or cuts in them, giving rise to two of its other common names: Swiss cheese plant and split-leaf philodendron (while monstera is not a type of philodendron, it is closely related to them).\n\nWhile young, this houseplant has a dense, bushy shape, but as it grows, it wants to vine out. You can keep it bushy with regular pruning, or let it climb up a vertical support (such as fishing line fastened into the ceiling), for a decidedly bold and tropical look.\n\nLooking for something smaller? Little Swiss monstera (Monstera adansonii) offers smaller leaves that are still big on texture. The older the plant and the better the conditions, the larger it gets and the bigger its leaves grow.",
    "instructions": "Grow monstera just about anywhere in your house! It tolerates low light, but grows faster and becomes more dramatic in a bright spot. In most areas, it can take some direct sun on its leaves when grown in the house.\n\nWater monstera regularly -- enough to keep the soil from drying out. The plant is somewhat drought tolerant, so you don't need to worry about keeping up with the watering all time time. It's a survivor! \n\nFertilize monstera a few times in spring and summer to keep it happiest, especially if the leaves start to look light green or pale around the veins. You can fertilize it more regularly -- even weekly -- if you want more growth. Either way, use a houseplant fertilizer and adhere to the directions on the product packaging. \n\nNote: Outdoors in frost-free areas such as Southern Florida, monstera can climb more than 60 feet and the leaves can grow 3 or even 4 feet wide. When happy outdoors, it produces calla-like blooms that turn into bizarre-looking fruit.  \n\nMonstera is not recommended for human or animal consumption.",

This hardy indoor plant features dark green leaves splashed and marbled in shades of yellow, cream, or white. Pothos is wonderfully versatile in the home: You can grow it in hanging baskets to trail down, let it climb a totem or trellis, or grow horizontally along a tabletop or mantle.",
    "instructions": "Pothos requires no special care indoors; it tolerates low light (but grows well in medium- and high-light spots, as well), low humidity, and the occasional missed watering. That said, pothos prefers moist (but not wet or saturated) soil, so it's best to water it when the top inch or so of the potting mix is dry. \n\nBecause it's such an easy houseplant, you don't need to worry about fertilizing pothos a lot. Feed it at least twice a year (every six months or so) with a general-purpose houseplant fertilizer (available from your local garden center). If you wish to fertilize the plant more frequently, you can certainly do so to encourage faster growth.\n\n\n\nPothos also functions as a living air purifier making it ideal for home and office settings. It's one of the best houseplants for any room of your home. \n\nThis easy-care houseplant is not intended for human or animal consumption.",

Sadly, while it doesn't immediately produce dollars, money tree is said bring good luck and is a favorite plant for applications of Feng Shui. The tree offers shiny, hand-shaped leaves that lend it a decidedly tropical appearance. \n\nYou may also see several money trees grown together in a single pot with their trunks braided together. This is common way to make it look more decorative and doesn't harm the plant at all. Money tree is frequently used as a specimen for bonsai, as well, and can develop a fat, dense trunk.",
    "instructions": "No matter which way your money tree is shaped when you get it, the plant does best in a bright spot and regular watering. This is a good houseplant if you tend to overwater plants, as it appreciates (but doesn't need) constantly moist soil. Being a tropical, money tree also appreciates abundant humidity. If the leaves start to have brown, crispy edges, placing it with other plants or near a small humidifier can help. \n\nYou can prune money tree at any time. Pruning money tree will help it grow to be more full and bushy. \n\nFertilize money tree no less than two times a year with a regular houseplant fertilizer. You can fertilize it more frequently if you want it to grow faster.

While names like Chinese money plant and pancake plant refer to its leaf shape, the Pilea Sharing Plant™ and pass-it-on plant come from how easy it is to share with friends.
