    "Elephant's ears are stunning houseplants. They often feature dark, shield-shaped foliage that may be accentuated by white veins running throughout the leaves. The plants will flower occasionally, sending up a spike with a calla-lily white, light yellow, or cream bloom, but the foliage is really how to tell if the plant is grown. Elephant's ear is the perfect plant for high-humidity areas such as bathrooms and kitchens.",
  instructionsWeb:
    "Elephant's ear grows best in bright light. Too much direct sun, especially in hot-summer climates, can burn the leaves, so these exotic indoor plants benefit from the protection of a sheer curtain from the window. Being true tropicals, they love humidity, so boost moisture levels in the air if it's especially dry. Water as needed, when the top inch or two of the soil dries to the touch. \n\nFertilize elephant's ear a couple of times a year to keep it healthy. The best seasons are spring and summer. Use any fertilizer formulated for use on houseplants.",

    "Monstera may be the perfect houseplant for you if you're looking to create a big, bold, tropical feel in your home. It features big (2-foot-wide) leaves that look like they have holes or cuts in them, giving rise to two of its other common names: Swiss cheese plant and split-leaf philodendron (while monstera is not a type of philodendron, it is closely related to them).\n\nWhile young, this houseplant has a dense, bushy shape, but as it grows, it wants to vine out. You can keep it bushy with regular pruning, or let it climb up a vertical support (such as fishing line fastened into the ceiling), for a decidedly bold and tropical look.\n\nLooking for something smaller? Little Swiss monstera (Monstera adansonii) offers smaller leaves that are still big on texture. The older the plant and the better the conditions, the larger it gets and the bigger its leaves grow.",
  instructionsWeb:
    "Grow monstera just about anywhere in your house! It tolerates low light, but grows faster and becomes more dramatic in a bright spot. In most areas, it can take some direct sun on its leaves when grown in the house.\n\nWater monstera regularly -- enough to keep the soil from drying out. The plant is somewhat drought tolerant, so you don't need to worry about keeping up with the watering all time time. It's a survivor! \n\nFertilize monstera a few times in spring and summer to keep it happiest, especially if the leaves start to look light green or pale around the veins. You can fertilize it more regularly -- even weekly -- if you want more growth. Either way, use a houseplant fertilizer and adhere to the directions on the product packaging. \n\nNote: Outdoors in frost-free areas such as Southern Florida, monstera can climb more than 60 feet and the leaves can grow 3 or even 4 feet wide. When happy outdoors, it produces calla-like blooms that turn into bizarre-looking fruit.  \n\nMonstera is not recommended for human or animal consumption.",
